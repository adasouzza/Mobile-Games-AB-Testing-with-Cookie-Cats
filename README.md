# Cookie Cats A/B Test Analysis

## Project Description
Cookie Cats is a popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment, featuring singing cats and a classic "connect three" puzzle style. This project conducts an A/B test analyzing the impact of moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 on player retention. The analysis involves various tasks, including hypothesis testing and bootstrap analysis.

## Project Tasks
1. **Of cats and cookies**
   Introduction to Cookie Cats and the A/B test analyzing the gate movement.

2. **The AB-test data**
   Exploration of the A/B test data, understanding its structure, and key features.

3. **The distribution of game rounds**
   Visualization and analysis of the distribution of game rounds played by users.

4. **Overall 1-day retention**
   Calculation and assessment of the overall 1-day retention rate.

5. **1-day retention by AB-group**
   Comparison of 1-day retention rates between the two AB groups.

6. **Should we be confident in the difference?**
   Hypothesis testing to evaluate whether the observed difference in 1-day retention is statistically significant.

7. **Zooming in on the difference**
   Detailed examination of the difference in retention rates, considering confidence intervals.

8. **The probability of a difference**
   Calculation of the probability of a difference in 1-day retention between the two groups.

9. **7-day retention by AB-group**
   Analysis of 7-day retention rates for both AB groups.

10. **Bootstrapping the difference again**
    Bootstrap analysis applied to 7-day retention, providing insights into the variability of the results.

11. **The conclusion**
    Summarization of findings and conclusions regarding the impact of moving the gate from level 30 to level 40 on player retention in Cookie Cats.
